## How to Contribute

### 1. Fork the Repository
First, fork this repository to your GitHub account. This will create a personal copy of the project where you can freely make changes.

### 2. Create a Branch
Before making any changes, create a new branch. Use a descriptive name for your branch that relates to the changes you're making (e.g., `feature/add-new-functionality` or `bugfix/fix-crash-on-start`).

To create a new branch:

```bash
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

### 3. Make Your Changes
Work on the changes you want to contribute. This could involve:

- Adding new features
- Fixing bugs

- Refactoring code

Make sure to:

- Follow the existing code style
- Write clear, concise commit messages
- Keep your changes focused on one issue or feature at a time

### 4. Test Your Changes
Ensure that your changes are well-tested. Run the existing unit tests or add new ones if necessary to ensure that everything is functioning correctly after your changes.

### 5. Commit Your Changes
Once your changes are complete and tested, commit them to your branch:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Brief description of changes"
```

### 6. Push Your Changes
Push your branch to your forked repository:

```bash
git push origin <branch-name>
```

### 7. Create a Pull Request
Go to the original repository and create a **pull request** from your branch. Provide a detailed description of what you've done, why the changes are needed, and any other relevant context.

- Ensure your pull request is against the `main` branch of the original repository.
